    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a PhD researcher in geomatics at ETH Zürich, specializing in machine
      learning for geospatial data modeling. My research focuses on ionospheric
      mapping and data fusion using GNSS and VLBI observations, with an emphasis
      on large-scale deep learning and HPC-based workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have strong experience with PyTorch, parameter estimation, and
      large-scale data processing. During my Master's, I worked on computer
      vision and multi-sensor data fusion for remote sensing applications.

      <h3>Ionospheric Slant TEC Modeling Based on GNSS Data with Machine Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Development of a data-driven model for slant total electron content (STEC)
        estimation directly from GNSS observations, bypassing single-layer
        ionospheric assumptions and mapping functions. The approach leverages
        deep learning to model spatiotemporal ionospheric variability and internally
        estimates electron density profiles along signal paths. Models are pre-trained
        on historical data and fine-tuned daily to adapt to real-time conditions,
        achieving significant RMSE reductions compared to standard GIM-based corrections.

      <h3>Fusion of GNSS and VLBI Data for Global Ionospheric Mapping</h3>
      <p>
        Machine learning–based data fusion framework combining dense GNSS-derived
        VTEC with sparse but complementary VLBI observations. Two fusion strategies
        are investigated: direct assimilation of station-based VLBI VTEC and
        end-to-end integration of VLBI differential TEC (DTEC). A weighted loss
        balances heterogeneous data volumes, with evaluation against independent
        Jason-3 altimetry measurements over a full year.

      <h3>A Comparative Study of VTEC Estimates Derived from S/X VLBI and VGOS Observations</h3>
      <p>
        Comparative analysis of vertical total electron content (VTEC) estimates
        derived from colocated S/X VLBI and VGOS observations during simultaneous
        sessions. Results show good agreement with Global Ionosphere Maps (GIM)
        and reveal improved stability and reduced sensitivity to solar activity
        for VGOS, highlighting its potential for enhanced ionospheric monitoring
        during disturbed space weather conditions.

      <h3>Master Thesis: A Shared Deep Feature Embedding of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for Building Detection</h3>
      <p>
        Joint deep learning framework for building segmentation using SAR (Sentinel-1)
        and optical (Sentinel-2) imagery. The work explores domain consistency through
        adversarial learning and input augmentation, enabling improved single-domain
        inference while leveraging multi-sensor information during training.

      <h3>Master Project: Vegetation Mapping with ICESat-2</h3>
      <p>
        Evaluation and bias correction of a global canopy height map using ICESat-2
        laser altimetry data across multiple test regions. Systematic over- and
        underestimation effects were analyzed and mitigated using tile-wise mean
        corrections and spatial smoothing, achieving improved global RMSE.

      <h3>Bachelor Thesis: Differentiation of Solid and Loose Rock on Orthophotos with Deep Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Semantic classification of solid rock and loose material in aerial imagery
        using a U-Net architecture with a ResNet encoder. The study supports
        permafrost mapping applications and demonstrates robust performance through
        cross-validation and extensive data augmentation.
